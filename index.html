    <p class="bold">I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, 
      if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

  <p class="quote">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
    I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. 
    I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
    The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
    the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
    learning from their experiences was easy.

    “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
    gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
    junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
    an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ”
